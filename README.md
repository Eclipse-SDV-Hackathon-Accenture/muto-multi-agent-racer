# Muto Multi Agent Race Challenge

## About

This challenge is built on top of the ROS Racers SDV blueprint to orchestrate and manage the F1Tenth stacks that power the miniature vehicles racing around a track.

Eclipse Muto orchestrates (install/start/stop/configure..)  ros software on racers and data collection from vehicles, providing remote control, race Apps and Services using SDV stacks. It also provides a default  agent (based on Eclipse Ditto) and a UI.
