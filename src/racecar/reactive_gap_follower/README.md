# F1/Tenth Follow-the-Gap Reactive Local Planner

F1/Tenth is an autonomous R/C car race with an emphasis primarily on a common platform--so competition is primarily between algorithms and less about the quality of the physical vehicle. Follow-the-Gap Reactive This is the algorithm that won the team from UNC-Chapel Hill won an F1/Tenth competition, held at CPSWeek 2019, in Montreal. The authors describe the algorithm as "follow the shortest safe path through the track, and drive as quickly as possible". Please read the following for more details on their experience with this algorithm https://www.nathanotterness.com/2019/04/the-disparity-extender-algorithm-and.html

This code and algorithm is the result of the very successfull F1/Tenth autonomous drive program.  The original algorithm dues to "Team UNC".  This implementation has been adopted from F1/Tenth course Labs (https://github.com/f1tenth/f1tenth_labs/tree/master/lab4)  and solutions and ported to ROS2.
